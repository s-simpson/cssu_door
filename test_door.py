# program test_door.py by Stuart Simpson
# May 31 2017
# 
# purpose to test the state of the door leads
# when the program is first started it prints the state of the door
# when the state of the door changes, the program prints the new state
#
#
# to run use python 2.7, raspian jessie 2017 04 10 version
# from command line:  python test_door.py
